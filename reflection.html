    The concept of responsive design is about the ability of an application or a website that can 
    respond to a user's screen size or platform. The responsive design is gradualness enhance, and it 
    is applied to a much more significant and more diverse aspect. The responsive design creates 
    more intelligence web pages or applications based on different environments. It can adapt to the 
    device/browser functional interface that will provide are exquisite appearance and perfect 
    experience.<br>
    <br>
    Nowadays, With the development of technology, people invent many new devices, for example, 
    mobile phones, tablets, laptops.  And people also create many new platforms and browsers, that 
    your website's page must have excellent compatibility with those new devices to display 
    correctly. Responsive web design represents an inevitable design tendency. The advantage of 
    responsive web design is satisfying in any different screen size, when we create a webpage, that 
    page can be significant and can be small. When the user opens the webpage, they will get the 
    perfect size webpage with their device screen size. The second advantage of responsive web 
    design takes less time than creating an additional stand-alone mobile site, which has been the 
    traditional approach. It will also save development costs and easy to maintain your website.<br>
    <br>
    When I was building my website, I use the &ltmeta&gttag, and viewport element.  The viewport 
    element will tell the browser how to control the webpage's dimensions and to scale. And then, I 
    use "width = device-width", this is meaning follow the screen width of the device. Next is 
    "initial-scale=1.0" this is to set the initial zoom level when the browser first loads the page. After 
    in my CSS, I use "@media (max-width: 960px)" this is when the screen size less than 960px, and 
    then I can set the specified for image or font size.<br>
